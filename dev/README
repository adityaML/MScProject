Contents
--------

This directory contains the development set texts and annotations for 48 sentences extracted from PubMed abstracts on the topic of the genic regulation of the sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.
Each sentence has three files named after an unique identifier in the following form:

        PMID-*-S?

The '*' is the place of the PubMed identifier of the document from which the sentence was extracted. The '?' is the sentence ordinal in the PubMed abstract.

        *.txt files contain the sentence text, each newline denotes a paragraph break.

        *.a1  files contain entity annotations (genes, proteins, operons, etc.). These files will be provided to the participants for training and testing.

        *.a2  files contain event and relation annotations. These files are provided to the participants for training only.


`dev.sif' is the gene regulation network corresponding to the annotations of the development documents. The SIF format is recognized by Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/), a software for visualizing graphs. For more details on how the graph is inferred from the annotations, see: https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst2013/tasks/gene-regulation-network.
The `GRN.props' file is also readable by Cytoscape; it contains a configuration in order to visualize a network with the same graphical attributes than the image in the task presentation page: https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst2013/tasks/gene-regulation-network.
