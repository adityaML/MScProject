The '*' is the place of the PubMed identifier of the document from which the sentence was extracted. The '?' is the sentence ordinal in the PubMed abstract.

        *.txt files contain the sentence text, each newline denotes a paragraph break.

        *.a1  files contain entity annotations (genes, proteins, operons, etc.). These files will be provided to the participants for training and testing.
